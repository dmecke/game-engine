# Game Engine

This is a collection of classes and systems written in TypeScript. 

The code is mainly for myself to be used in my own personal games. I made it publicly available though as it might come in handy for someone.

### Install via yarn:
```shell
yarn install @dmecke/game-engine
```

### Install via npm:
```shell
npm install @dmecke/game-engine
```

### Publish new version to NPM
```shell
yarn publish --access=public
```
